# Lab Exercises
Labs are short programming exercises that will be assigned for each lab session. The goal of each exercise is to reinforce a new concept introduced in lecture. All lab exercises need to be turned in to [Turnin](https://turnin.ecst.csuchico.edu/) by 11:59pm, the Friday following the lab in which they are assigned. If you are not able to complete all exercises, you can still receive partial credit for any work that is completed and turned in.
