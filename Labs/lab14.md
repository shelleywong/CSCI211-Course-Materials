  - Lab 14 Project Goals:

    - Display the results of your algorithm in a way that is clear and informative (provides insight on Your Question)
    - Make at least one commit to your CSUChico-CSCI211 project repo<br>

Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub, so I can see your project progress. Remember to include a brief but descriptive commit message:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"

Reminder: Even though there are not any new lab exercises this week, you will get credit for attending lab, working on your programming assignments, and making progress on your final project!
