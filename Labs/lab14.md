# Lab 14

Discussion/Questions/Answers/Help on Binary Search Tree (p7)<br>

Attendance is still required. If you turn in a complete version of p7 that passes ALL tests before the start of lab, you do not have to attend -- make sure to email me to confirmm.

If you finish early, you should review [previous semester exams](http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~trhenry/classes/211.s17/exams.html) and make sure you are ready for the Final Exam.
