  - Lab 14 Project Goal: Complete your unique algorithm (make at least one commit to your project repo)<br>

Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub, so I can see your project progress. Remember to include a brief but descriptive commit message:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"
$ git push origin main
```

Reminder: Even though there are not any new lab exercises this week, you will get credit for attending lab, working on your programming assignments, and making progress on your final project!
