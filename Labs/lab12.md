# Lab 12

* Discussion, Q&A, help on the Shapes assignment (P6)
* [CURE-E Project](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI211-Course-Materials/blob/main/CURE-E/finalProject.md) Work Time
  - Lab 12 Project Goals:
    - Create an initial commit that includes the project's initial setup (e.g. a new directory, setting up the project structure, adding any necessary project files)
    - Create a class or struct to hold your data entries
    - Create a data structure to hold your data (based on an abstract data type discussed in class -- linked list, stack, queue, priority queue, or binary tree)
    - Make at least one commit to your CSUChico-CSCI211 project repo<br>

Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub, so I can see your project progress. Remember to include a brief but descriptive commit message:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"
$ git push origin main
```

For Lab 12, submit a text entry to Canvas that contains the following:

* the date of the commit(s) you made for the Lab 12 Project Goals
* the commit message(s) (if needed, include some additional context here so it is clear which tasks you were working on)
* a URL link to the commit(s) in your git repo (let me know if you are not sure what I mean by this)

If you have any questions about completing this, please let me know!

> Note: your grade for project progress (adding, committing, and pushing code to GitHub) will be part of the CURE-E Final Project grade (it is one of the criteria for your Computer Program and Documentation)

Reminder: Even though there are not any new lab exercises this week, you will get credit for attending lab, working on your programming assignments, and making progress on your final project!
