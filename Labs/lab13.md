    - Discuss your progress on the CURE-E Project with at least one peer and submit a brief write-up<br>


## Project Progress - Git Commits

Work on Lab 13 Project Goals and commit your progress to your CSUChico-CSCI211 project repo.

> Note: Lab 13 Project Goals are recommendations to help you keep on track. If you do not complete everything, or you complete different tasks than the ones described here, do not worry about it -- the goal if for you to make incremental progress, whatever that means in your situation.

### Lab 13 Project Goals
- Get all input from the dataset
  - Access the dataset (csv file) and retrieve the data needed for your project
  - Remember, you can refer to my example in the `assets/` folder, which provides one way to extract data from a csv file and put it into a format that is more similar to the input files we have used for CSCI211 programming assignments
- Add the input to your data structure
  - Test that your insert function works as expected (make changes to the implementation as needed)
- Print out all entries in a readable format
  - Test that your print function works as expected (data may or may not be organized at this point, but you should be able to confirm that you are populating your data structure as expected)

- Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub, so I can see your current project progress. Remember to include a brief but descriptive commit message:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"
$ git push origin main
```

To demonstrate your project progress, submit this [Lab 12-15 Project Progress - Git Commits Google Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckOf9F8l39hnXigfJlu9uXFGQ0pMf_9ZEsJRVuDWMzAoClfw/viewform?usp=sf_link). This form can be edited and resubmitted as many times as necessary. In the form, you will need to provide a URL link to the commits in your git repo, as well as the dates and commit messages for your work on the CURE-E Final Project.

Note: You will need to be logged in to your \@mail.csuchico.edu or \@csuchico.edu Google account in order to take the Google Survey. If you get a message that you are unable to access the survey, try using your Chico portal username and password to login to Google. If you are not sure how to proceed, feel free to ask for help!<br>

Reminder: You should aim to make your git commit messages specific yet concise - clearly state what changes have been made to the project (including some context and reasoning if needed), in a way that others can clearly understand at a glance.

If you have any questions about completing this, please let me know!

## Project Progress - Peer Discussion and Write-up

During one of the lab sessions this week, spend a few minutes discussing your current CURE-E Project progress with another student. You may work on this in groups of 2 or 3. You may meet with the same partner(s) each week or meet with different partners each week.

**During your discussion**, each individual should share the following:
* A brief overview of your project (make sure your partner knows a little about your research question, dataset, and stakeholders). Note that if you are meeting with the same group each week, you may not need to cover this every week.
* What you have accomplished or worked on this week or since the last discussion.
* Any challenges or questions that came up for you this week.
* What you plan to work on during the upcoming week.

Make time for everyone in the group to provide and receive brief feedback or suggestions!

**After each discussion, write a brief reflection**. The write-up should include:
* Partner's Name and Project
  - Include your partnerâ€™s name and a brief description of their project.
* Summarize your partner's work
  - Identify a couple key points discussed by your partner (or one of your partners). What was one thing they accomplished or worked on? What was one challenge they encountered or question they had?
* Reflect on your own progress
  - Describe any feedback or new insights gained from your discussion about your project, then briefly explain how you plan to incorporate the feedback or insights into your project.
* Next Steps
  - After your discussion, what will be your immediate next steps on the CURE-E Project?

Your Peer Discussion Write-up should be submitted to Canvas as a text entry or PDF.

> Reminder: practicing making incremental progress (adding, committing, and pushing code to GitHub, and discussing your project progress with a peer) is an important component of the CURE-E Final Project!
