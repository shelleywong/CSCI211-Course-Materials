# Lab 15

> Note: your grade for adding, committing, and pushing code to GitHub to show project progress will be part of the overall grade for the CURE-E Final Project (Computer Program and Documentation)

* Discussion, Q&A, help on the Binary Search Tree assignment (P7)
* [CURE-E Project](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI211-Course-Materials/blob/main/CURE-E/finalProject.md) Work Time
  - Lab 15 Project Goals:
    - Add documentation to your project repo (requires at least 1 commit to your CSUChico-CSCI211 project repo)
    - Finish preparing your visual
    - Practice your presentation/elevator pitch
    - Complete the reflection/self-assessment survey<br>

Add, commit, and push your documentation and any other code to GitHub, so I can see your project progress. Remember to include a brief but descriptive commit message:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"
$ git push origin main
```

> Note: your grade for project progress (adding, committing, and pushing code to GitHub) will be part of the CURE-E Final Project grade (it is one of the criteria for your Computer Program and Documentation)

Reminder: Even though there are not any new lab exercises this week, you will get credit for attending lab, working on your programming assignments, and making progress on your final project!
