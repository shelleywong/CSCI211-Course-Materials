# Lab 15

* Discussion, Q&A, help on the Binary Search Tree assignment (P7)
* [CURE-E Project](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI211-Course-Materials/blob/main/CURE-E/finalProject.md) Work Time
  - Lab 15 Project Goal: Add documentation to your project repo, finish preparing your visual, practice your presentation/elevator pitch, and complete the reflection/self-assessment survey<br>

Add, commit, and push your documentation and any other code to GitHub, so I can see your project progress. Remember to include a brief but descriptive commit message:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"
$ git push origin main
```

Reminder: Even though there are not any new lab exercises this week, you will get credit for attending lab, working on your programming assignments, and making progress on your final project!
