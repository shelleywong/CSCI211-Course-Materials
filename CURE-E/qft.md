## Introduction

The skill of question asking is far too rarely deliberately taught in school. The Question Formulation Technique (QFT) provides a simple yet powerful way to teach students how to formulate, work with, and use their own questions.<br>

You will need to develop a question that your CURE-E Final Project will set out to answer. This semester, we are focusing on [publicly available historical weather data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) for Chico, CA or surrounding communities. Data is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We can search for and request data using their [Climate Data Online Search](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) tool.<br>

## Attitude

Entrepreneurial Mindset: Flexible and Adaptable, Creative and Innovative, Initiative and Self Reliance, Communicate and Collaborate, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Opportunity Recognition

## Preparation

Nowadays, we have access to vast amounts of data, but it can sometimes be difficult to extract useful information from that data. Take a look at the example dataset: `assets/chico-weather-2018-2022.csv`. Each row displays the readings from a given day. Columns include station ID, station name, date, and data related to precipitation and air temperature. The [Global Historical Climatology Network Daily Documentation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GHCND_documentation.pdf) can be used as a reference. While the data is organized, it is still challenging to find specific pieces of information.<br>

Take a few minutes to individually look at the data and think about different types of insight that could be gained from the data.<br>

## Process

Now it is time to start formulating some questions!<br>

1. Question Focus
  - :heavy_check_mark: Focus on the example dataset, while being aware that your group can choose a different dataset for your CURE-E project (e.g. for a specific station, for a longer date range, etc).
  - :heavy_check_mark: You can start with simple questions (e.g. What is the highest temperature?), but then consider questions that are more complex, including a range of dates (months, years, seasons), several locations, multiple categories (e.g. precipitation and minimum temperature), different statistical calculations (e.g. mean average, range, variance, percentile).
  - :heavy_check_mark: As you formulate questions, think about some potential stakeholders (community members or groups who would benefit from this information).
2. Produce Your Questions
  - :heavy_check_mark: Follow the rules:
    - a) Ask as many questions as you can
    - b) Do not stop to discuss, judge or answer
    - c) Record exactly as stated
    - d) Change statements into questions
  - :heavy_check_mark: Number your questions
3. Improve Your Questions
  - :heavy_check_mark: Categorize questions as Closed or Open-ended
    - a) Closed-Ended: Answered with “yes,” “no” or one word
    - b) Open-Ended: Require longer explanation
  - :heavy_check_mark: Change questions from one type to another
4. Strategize
  - :heavy_check_mark: Prioritize your questions
  - :heavy_check_mark: Action plan or discuss next steps
  - :heavy_check_mark: Share
5. Reflect
  - :heavy_check_mark: Individual written reflection or small group reflection
  - :heavy_check_mark: Volunteers share out to full group

## Conclusion

The goal today is to generate ideas for potential questions you can answer through your CURE-E Final Project. In the upcoming weeks, work with your group to determine a stakeholder and decide on at least one question for each group member to focus on. Check in with the instructor to confirm if your questions are sufficiently complex for the Final Project.
