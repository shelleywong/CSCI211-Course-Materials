## Warm-Up Question

What do you think about when you hear the term "entrepreneur"?

## Introduction

Like most things in life, being an entrepreneur is a learned experience. It is something that one can learn and master. Certainly there are innate abilities that favor being a good entrepreneur, just like height can advantage the basketball player, long fingers can help the pianist, or extroversion benefits the politician. However, for all the innate abilities or “gifts”, there are plenty of exceptions when hard work and tenacity resulted in the same success and “talent”.<br>

### What is an Entrepreneurial Mindset?

An entrepreneurial mindset is a set of skills that enable people to identify and make the most of opportunities, overcome and learn from setbacks, and succeed in a variety of settings. Research shows that an entrepreneurial mindset is valued by employers, boosts educational attainment and performance, and is crucial for creating new businesses.<br>

The Entrepreneurial Mindset is as much about understanding what attitudes and behaviors benefit the entrepreneur as much as it is about recognizing one’s own attitude and behaviors and making small incremental adjustments that eventually result in consistent habits and ways of being that align with the Entrepreneurial Mindset. Remember, the attitudes and behaviors that define the Entrepreneurial Mindset are not about whether or not one has them; they are about continually reminding oneself what they are and applying them with enthusiasm and conscious effort.<br>

“My greatest challenge has been to change the mindset of people. We see things the way our minds have instructed our eyes to see.” Muhammad Yunus, Managing Director, Grameen Bank<br>

In your small group, explore one of the domains of the entrepreneurial mindset, identify some of the key characteristics, and discuss why this particular domain is important for students in an academic or research setting:

* **Critical Thinking & Problem Solving**: The capacity to apply higher-level, process-oriented thinking, consider an issue from a range of possible perspectives, and use that reasoning to make decisions.
* **Flexibility & Adaptability**: The ability and willingness to change actions and plans to overcome present and future challenges.
* **Communication & Collaboration**: The ability to clearly express ideas to an intended audience, including persuading others to work towards a common goal.
