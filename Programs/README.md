# Programming Assignments

Over the course of the semester, there will be 7 programming assignments. All programs must be completed individually. Each assignment contains program-specific requirements. All assignments should follow the General Requirements listed below. You may be asked to explain your code to the instructor or a lab assistant during lab time or office hours, and if you are unable to adequately do so, a percentage may be taken off your grade for that assignment. Programming assignments must be turned in to [INGInious](https://inginious.csuchico.edu/) by the due date (check INGInious or Canvas to confirm).

## General Requirements

Your first goal is to make sure your code is correct and passes all tests; however, it is also important to think about writing code that is readable and easy to maintain. The projects in this course are relatively small individual assignments. In the real world, you will most likely be contributing to a large codebase with many contributors. Thus, it is good practice to follow style guidelines, be consistent, and write code that other engineers can easily understand.<br>

### C++ Version

Currently, your code should target C++11 (your code will be compiled with the C++11 standard: `-std=c++11`). All assignments in this course can be completed with C++11 features. Outside of this class, you are likely to use newer versions of C++, but even then, you should consider portability to other environments before using features from C++14, C++17 and newer versions in your projects.

### Reminder

Getting your program to pass the provided tests is only one component of the programming assignments. Other grading components include:
* **Does your program pass the hidden tests?**
  * The provided tests may not cover all of the project specifications; it's your job to consider all potential cases.
  * It is helpful to create your own tests to address any additional cases.
* **Does your program follow the instructions?**
  * If the instructions say to use a particular data structure, make sure to use that data structure. If the instructions require the use of dynamic memory, make sure you've managed memory correctly.
  * There's a lot of information included in each assignment write-up, but all of it is there for a reason, and it is provided to help you succeed.
* **Have you included sufficient and useful comments?**
  * You don't need to be overly verbose or have comments on every line.
  * However, you are expected to have a file header (with brief file or class comments) in every file you submit. You should also have comments for any non-trivial function and tricky/non-obvious/important code implementation.
  * You should give appropriate and descriptive names to variables such that no additional comments are required to accompany them, but if necessary or helpful, include comments with variable declarations.
* **Is your program well-formatted and organized?**
  * Things to consider include proper and consistent indentation, descriptive variable names, and usage of functions.<br>

Ask the instructor if you have questions about any programming assignment expectations.
