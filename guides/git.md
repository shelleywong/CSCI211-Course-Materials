# Git Overview

These notes are particularly useful for completing [Lab 01](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI211-Course-Materials/blob/main/Labs/lab01.md):
  * [Exercise 6: Git Basics Survey](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI211-Course-Materials/blob/main/Labs/lab01.md#exercise-6-git-basics-survey)

## What is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system. It helps you keep track of your source code history, allowing you to see any changes and revert back to a previous version if necessary. Git makes it easier to manage both small individual projects and large collaborative projects. It is free and open source software released under the [GNU General Public License version 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0). To use Git, you must have it installed on your local machine.<br>

## What are GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket?

GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket provide tools that help manage and host Git repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket utilize a graphical user interface and are accessible on the web.<br>
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * Version control, collaboration on open-source projects (Education accounts are free)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
  * Version control with baked in CI/CD (Unlimited private/public repos for all)
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
  * Version control host for GIT or MERCURIAL (Education accounts are free)

  * [GitLab Cheat Sheet](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
  * [Atlassian (BitBucket) Cheat Sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)
  * [freeCodeCamp Git Cheat Sheet](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-cheat-sheet-helpful-git-commands-with-examples/#heading-reverting-changes-in-git) - An extensive guide to Git commands, with explanations and examples (the other cheat sheets listed here highlight some of the most common commands and are great for a quick reference; this one goes more in-depth).
* My [Git Basics video](https://csuchico-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/swong26_csuchico_edu/EYw6N7y3X0VDo6yKbOnHzfsBTDhmEr5w02mHp0ASko7Jiw) aims to address all topics covered in the Git Basics Survey (Lab 01, Exercise 6). It is mainly focused on providing examples and context for using Git and GitHub as an individual -- starting a project, day-to-day work, branching and merging, synching a local repo with a remote repo, and understanding what a remote repo hosting service (like GitHub) provides. (~50 min)
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a great interactive web tutorial that covers both basic and more advanced Git commands and techniques. The tutorial goes beyond what is necessary for this class, but it provides good practice and preparation for future classes and industry work.
* Refer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github) for additional guidance on working with GitHub.
* Check out [Getting Started with Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-started-with-git) in the GitHub Docs for instructions on setting up you Git username and password (necessary if cloning GitHub repos with HTTPS) and managing remote repositories.
* [GitHub's SSH instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) - Connecting with SSH is secure and can simplify your git workflow. I find their sections on [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to be particularly useful.
* [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - Offers free access to tools and services used by professional developers, including Travis CI
